Bluetooth is a wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances (about 30 meters). Recently it became quite popular as a substitute for data cables, and today almost every new phone is equipped with a Bluetooth device.
The goal of this project is to develop a Bluetooth manager application for cellular phones that will be able to intelligently activate and deactivate the phoneâ€™s Bluetooth device in order to save battery power. By studying the users' behavior and analyzing rules specified by them, the manager will operate the Bluetooth device in an intelligent manner.
